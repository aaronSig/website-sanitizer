		</p><p>The second six months of your baby’s life is a time of fast development, and for most parents, they will feel like they have come out of the sleep-deprived early days and are really getting the hang of parenting. <span id="more-778"></span>Babies become stronger, more communicative, dextrous, mobile and much more aware at this age. They will explore everything by putting it in their mouth, and will chew on literally anything in their path to ease sore gums when <a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/elc-blossom-farm-water-teether.html" target="_blank">teething</a>. As co-ordination and dexterity improves, your baby will begin to enjoy <a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/toys-gifts/baby-toddler.html" target="_blank">toys that move or make a noise</a> when they touch them. They will also enjoy toys that can be taken apart. They will sit up, crawl and stand and begin to see the world from a different viewpoint.</p><h2><strong>Age and skills</strong></h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
</p><ul>
<li>Between 6 and 12 months, babies will learn that things they cannot see may be hidden and not gone.</li>
<li>They will choose particular toys to play with and show affection towards favourite dolls and teddies.</li>
<li>They will grasp objects, pass them from hand to hand and bang them together.</li>
<li>They will crawl, stand up and take their first few steps.</li>
<li>They will enjoy hide and seek games.</li>
<li>They will learn to use toys such as telephones and hammers correctly.</li>
<li>They will be able to recognise and identify pictures in books.</li>
</ul><p>Suitable toys – teddies and dolls, noisy toys, shape sorters, blocks, nesting containers, multi-activity toys, <a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/toys-gifts/books-audio.html" target="_blank">books</a>, basic role play toys, <a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/toys-gifts/baby-toddler/bath-toys.html" target="_blank">bath toys</a>, moving toys.</p><h2><strong>Bath and water toys</strong></h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
</p><p>Floating and pouring toys will help your baby learn about water and make&nbsp;bath time more fun. <a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/toys-gifts/baby-toddler/bath-toys/bathtime-shape-sorting-fish.html" target="_blank">Shape Sorting Fish</a> which introduces first numbers through song.</p><h2><strong>Soft dolls and teddies</strong></h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
</p><p><a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/mothercare-my-first-bear-pink.html" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-777 size-thumbnail" src="http://mothercarefamilycard.ie/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/mothercare-first-bear-pink-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></a>Choose&nbsp;dolls, teddies and stuffed animals&nbsp;that are small enough for your baby to pick up and play with. There should be no parts they can pull off and put in their mouth. <a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/toys-gifts/baby-toddler/soft-toys.html" target="_blank">Check some soft toys here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Noisy toys</strong></h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
</p><p>Wooden spoons, saucepans and plastic bowls will provide your baby with all they need to make noise, or you could buy a toy drum or baby band – something like the <a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/mothercare-baby-ocean-whale-musical-pull.html" target="_blank">Baby Ocean Whale Musical Pull</a>.</p><h2><strong>Shape sorters</strong></h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
</p><p>Posting objects into the right opening helps your baby learn about shapes and matching, with <a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/activity-triangle.html" target="_blank">Activity Triangle</a>.</p><h2><strong>Blocks</strong></h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
</p><p>Choose&nbsp;plastic blocks or something a bit softer like the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/mothercare-alphabet-blocks.html" target="_blank">Alphabet Blocks</a>. At this stage, your baby will only stack two or three blocks at a time.</p><h2><strong>Nesting containers</strong></h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
</p><p>Sets of beakers that fit inside one another are great for hide and seek games, where smaller cups can be covered by larger ones. See <a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/mothercare-stacking-cups.html" target="_blank">Stacking Cups (8 in Pack)</a>.</p><h2><strong>Activity centres</strong></h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
</p><p>Activity centres&nbsp;are single units that combine several toys that move, spin and make a noise. They provide a great variety of play and some even fasten to the side of the cot.Options: <a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/sensory-dome.html" target="_blank">Sensory Dome</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/lights-and-sounds-walker.html" target="_blank">Lights and Sounds Walker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/mothercare-twist-and-bounce-entertainer.html" target="_blank">Mothercare Twist and Bounce Entertainer</a></p><h2><strong>Moving toys</strong></h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
</p><p>Simple cars and other push-along toys like the&nbsp;board book, for example the Dear Zoo Board Book&nbsp;appeal to babies that are beginning to crawl, as they give chase to the car shooting off in front of them!</p><h2><strong>Books</strong></h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
</p><p>When your baby is able to turn pages by themselves, you should introduce&nbsp;board books&nbsp;and use lift-the-flap books to share hide and seek games, something like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/dear-zoo-noisy-book.html" target="_blank">Dear Zoo Sound</a>. Reading to your baby from as early as possible is a great idea. Books are like toys to babies, so let them get used to playing with books, and read them short stories to begin with.</p><h2><strong>Role play toys</strong></h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
</p><p>A&nbsp;hammering bench, toy telephone like the cute little&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mothercare.ie/large-activity-ladybird.html" target="_blank">Activity Ladybird</a> and bucket and spade will encourage your baby’s hand-eye-coordination as well as getting them used to handling different shapes and textures.</p><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
</p><ul>
<li>As your baby will put toys in his mouth, it is important to keep them clean. You should wash those that are washable and check plastic toys for sharp or roughened edges.</li>
<li>Always supervise your baby when playing banging games or using hammers.</li>
<li>Never leave your baby alone in the bath or in water, even for the shortest period of time.</li>
